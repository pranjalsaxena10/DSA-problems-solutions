How to identify a Dynamic Programming Problem:

1. First check whether do we have choices related to input given, if yes => try to think of choice diagram
2. See in problem, something related to optimality of input is asked => like maximum, minimum or peak


DP Problems can be summarized as below:


| Problem | Variants |
| - | - |
| 0/1 Knapsack | 1. Subset Sum<br>2. Equal Sum Parition<br>3. Count of Subset Sum <br>4. Minimum Subset Sum Difference<br> 5. Target Sum<br> 6. # of subsets with given diff |
| Unbounded Knapsack |   |
| Fibonacci |   |
| LCS |   |
| LIS |   |
| Kadane's Algorithm |   |
| Matrix Chain Multiplication |   |
| Trees questions |   |
| Grid questions |   |
| Miscallenous |   |
