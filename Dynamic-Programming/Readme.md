How to identify a Dynamic Programming Problem:

1. First check whether do we have choices related to input given, if yes => try to think of choice diagram
2. See in problem, something related to optimality of input is asked => like maximum, minimum or peak

DP Problems can be summarized as below:


| Pattern | Variants |
